# Funding and Donations

You can support the development of my open-source projects
by making a one-time or regular donation
to me (Jonas van den Berg).
You may choose one of the following options to support me financially:

- **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WJE4KJ45EZQUN)**
- **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jonasberge)**

Your donation supports the development of the following projects.  

- **[Discord Music Presence](https://github.com/jonasberge/discord-music-presence)**
  â€” [Roadmap](https://github.com/jonasberge/discord-music-presence/blob/master/README.md)  
  Show people what you're listening to on Discord,
  no matter the media player you use.
  Looks like Discord's Spotify status,
  but also works with TIDAL, Qobuz, foobar200
  and really any other media player.
- *And more projects in the future...*
