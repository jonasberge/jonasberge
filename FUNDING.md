# Funding and Donations

You can support the development of my open-source projects
by making a one-time or regular donation
to me (Jonas van den Berg).
You may choose one of the following options to support me financially:

- **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WJE4KJ45EZQUN)**
- **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jonasberge)**

Your donation supports the development of the following projects.  

- **[Discord Music Presence](https://github.com/jonasberge/discord-music-presence)**
  â€” [Roadmap](https://github.com/jonasberge/discord-music-presence/blob/master/README.md)  
  Show people what you're listening to on Discord,
  no matter the media player you use.
  Looks like Discord's Spotify status,
  but also works with TIDAL, Qobuz, foobar200
  and really any other media player.

> Click on the **Roadmap** link, to see where the development of each project is headed
> and what impact your donation has! More projects will be added in the future.

If you would like to make suggestions,
you can always do that by opening an issue in the respective repository
or by sending me an e-mail (the address is listed on my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/jonasberge)).
I will be happy to respond in a timely manner.

Thank you for your support and your interest in my projects!

Kindly,  
Jonas van den Berg
