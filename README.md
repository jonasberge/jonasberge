Currently planning on building an Android app for live song lyrics and building a single desktop/mobile app solution for sharing what music you're listening to (for TIDAL, Qobuz, any generic media player, other than Spotify, which is already deeply integrated) via your Discord status. Also working on improving [TIDAL Discord presence](https://github.com/purpl3F0x/TIDAL-Discord-Rich-Presence-UNOFFICIAL/pull/100), making my local Darktable library [accessible programmatically](https://github.com/jonasberge/darktable-graphql) through GraphQL for my photography portfolio, finishing my [AOC 2023 solutions](https://github.com/jonasberge/adventofcode-2023).
