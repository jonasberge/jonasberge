Currently working on improving [TIDAL Discord presence](https://github.com/purpl3F0x/TIDAL-Discord-Rich-Presence-UNOFFICIAL/pull/100), making my local Darktable library [accessible programmatically](https://github.com/jonasberge/darktable-graphql) through GraphQL for my photography portfolio and finishing my [AOC 2023 solutions](https://github.com/jonasberge/adventofcode-2023).
